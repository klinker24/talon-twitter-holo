*Quick Access to Links and Pictures*

My friend gave me an idea halfway through the developement of this app: what if we didn't have time to look through all of our new tweets, or didn't want to? Isn't there a way to limit those tweets to the once that we actually care enough to look at? So he suggested a timeline of just pictures and just links. 

It is a simple idea, but works flawlessly in Talon. After enabling the "Extra Pages" option under "Advanced Settings", all you have to do to sort through these tweets is swipe to the left of your main timeline. Any tweets that you have containing an image, whether that is Instagram, a Twitter picture, or a YouTube video, they will appear on this exclusive "Pictures" timeline. Same goes for your links! Swipe two pages to the left of your main timeline for quick access to all your news stories or articles your friends think you should read!

It does take a little bit of extra time to load and sift through the data on these pages, so although it isn't downloading new data every time you swipe to and away from them, you will have to excuse the spinner that appears for a split second while the data is loaded! If you feel like it slows down the app to much to have these available (it won't), then just disable them from "Advanced Settings"!
