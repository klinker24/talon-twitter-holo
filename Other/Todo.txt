-- Staged for Release (Roadmap) --

NOTE: These are by no means final. I work on things when I get the time and in the order that I feel is most important...
If something new comes along that I want to work on instead, then I will do that :)
Some of these things have been on here for quite awhile and I just haven't gotten to them because I keep finding new things that
I think are more important for the development of the app.

Please keep that in mind when viewing this roadmap. It is simply a rough estimate, and I will not be providing any timetable for it
either, or ETA's, so please do not ask for them

    Version 4.1
        - Pictures below tweet causes weird expansion on plus
        - sent direct messages are saved over and over again
        - gifs working from the launcher page

    Version 4.2
        - expand the widget for mentions and multiple account support
        - 1x1 "tweeting" widget just to compose a tweet
        - timestamp on widget
        - Widget with an unread count

        - mute users for a time period
            - need a new database (stores just name and expiration time)
            - Just write in the names and when they should expire, then start a service when expiration goes off
            - Make sure the service runs on start too
