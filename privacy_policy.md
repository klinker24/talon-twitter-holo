# Klinker Apps Privacy Policy

My privacy policy is really simple. 

1. I _don't care_ about, and have no use, for your personal data or data on you of any kind.
2. I _don't collect_ any data, of any type or format, personal or publicly available.
3. I _don't sell_ any data, since I have nothing collected, if someone were to come asking.

Privacy usually isn't simple, but with _Klinker Apps_, it is. Your data is your own, that's how it should be.

#### Policy Application

This policy applies to the following _Klinker Apps_ work on the _Google Play Store_:

- [Talon for Twitter](talon.klinker.xyz)
- [EvolveSMS](evolve.klinker.xyz)
- [Source News Reader](source.klinker.xyz)
- [Blur Launcher](blur.klinker.xyz)
- [Sliding Messaging Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.messaging_donate)
- [Sliding Emoji Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klinker.android.emoji_keyboard)

#### Policy Exclusion

Our latest messaging app, [Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.klinker.messenger), cannot use this same privacy policy. It needs user data for a unique account to access the service. 

The privacy policy for this application can be found here: https://privacy.messenger.klinkerapps.com
